# Chinese HealthNER Corpus

Chinese <strong>Health</strong>care <strong>N</strong>amed <strong>E</strong>ntity <strong>R</strong>ecognition <strong>(HealthNER)</strong> Corpus is collected and annotated by NYCU NLP Lab. (https://ainlp.tw/)  

We firstly crawled articles from websites that provide healthcare information, online health-related news and medical question/answer forums. We then removed all HTML tags, images, videos and embedded web advertisements and split the remaining texts into several sentences. We randomly selected partial sentences to retain content diversity for manual annotation.

A total of 10 entity types are described and some examples are provided in Table 1 for healthcare named entity annotation. Three undergraduate students majoring in Chinese language were trained in word segmentation and the named entity tagging task. Inter-annotator agreement is 84.1%. All annotators were asked to discuss differences and seek consensus. Finally, we had 2,531 testing sentences with 7,305 named entities. Each sentence contains an average of 47.92 characters or 28.67 words, and an average of 2.89 named entities. When the agreement was reached, each annotator was then asked to process the remaining sentences individually. As a result, there were 28,161 training sentences, each with an average of 49.44 characters or 29.99 words, and 2.17 named entities.<br><br>

<br>In summary, our constructed Chinese HealthNER corpus includes 30,692 sentences with a total of around 1.5 million characters or 91.7 thousand words. Table 2 shows detailed statistics of mutually exclusive training and test sets. The entity type distribution in training and test sets is similar. The most common type was BODY (26,411 cases or 38.58% of the total), followed by the SYMP (12,904 cases), DISE (10,079 cases) and CHEM (6,834 cases). These 4 most common types of named entities thus accounted for about 82% of the total 68,460 entities, with the remaining 6 types accounting for 18%.<br><br>
